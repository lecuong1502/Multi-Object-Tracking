# Multi-Object-Tracking
- Libraries:
    + Ultralytics YOLO (You only look once): The output from Ultralytics trackers is consistent with standard object detection but has the added value of object IDs. This makes it easy to track objects in video streams and perform subsequent analytics. Here's why you should consider using Ultralytics YOLO for your object tracking needs:
        - Efficiency: Process video streams in real-time without compromising accuracy.
        - Flexibility: Supports multiple tracking algorithms and configurations.
        - Ease of Use: Simple Python API and CLI options for quick integration and deployment.
        - Customizability: Easy to use with custom trained YOLO models, allowing integration into domain-specific applications.
